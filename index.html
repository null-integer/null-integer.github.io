                    <p><span id="currentTime">Hello!</span> I'm Alfonso and I love everything about computer science; from debugging a stubborn error to when the program finally works. 
                        Since my sixth-grade introduction to programming, I have found it enjoyable. I recently graduated with a master's in computer science, and I'm eager to start a demanding IT career to support corporate growth. I'd like to work in a role where I can put my present knowledge to use, while also learning new abilities on my own or in a team. 
                        Here are a few technologies I've worked with:

                                    In 2019, the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley organized a team competition for high school students. The participating teams were given a two-hour timeframe to accumulate points by solving 10 programming challenges of increasing complexity. Despite being newcomers to the competition, my teammates and I managed to outperform 15 other teams, securing <strong>5th place</strong>.
