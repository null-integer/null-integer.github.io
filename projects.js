    {projectSection:"Algorithms & Data Structures",projectName: "Trend Tracker", projectDescription:"The trend tracker assignment consists of constructing a vector-based data structure that tracks information about a collection of hashtags. The TrendTracker class has eight class methods: insert(string ht), size(), tweeted(string ht), popularity(string ht), top_trend(), top_three_thrends(vector&lt;string&gt; &amp;T), remove(string ht), top_k_trends(vector&lt;string&gt; &amp;T, int k).<br/><br/>Insert(string ht) - The insert method iterates the vector, looking for ht. If ht is found, the method ends early, doing nothing to the current vector. On the other hand, if ht is found, an empty entry is added to the vector. This method runs in O(n) time.<br/> <br/>Insert(string ht) - The insert method iterates the vector, looking for ht. If ht is found, the method ends early, doing nothing to the current vector. On the other hand, if ht is found, a new, empty entry is added to the vector. This method runs in O(n) time.<br/><br/>Size() - The size method returns the number of hashtags in the trend tracker. This utilizes the vector size method to run in constant time.<br/><br/>Tweeted(string ht) - The tweeted function acts as an incrementer for the trends. Similar to the insert function, the vector is traversed in linear time, looking for the string to modify.<br/><br/>Popularity(string ht) - This method returns the popularity integer belonging to the hashtag.<br/><br/>Top_trend() - The trend with the highest popularity integer is returned.<br/><br/>Top_three_trends(vector&lt;string&gt; &amp;T) - The top 3 trends with the highest popularity integers are stored in the T vector.<br/><br/>Remove(string ht) - Removes the given hashtag from the trend tracker vector.<br/><br/>Top_k_trends(vector&lt;string&gt; &amp;T, int k) - The top k trends with the highest popularity integers are stored in the T vector.<br/>", projectImages:["trendtracker.png"]},
    {projectSection:"Algorithms & Data Structures",projectName: "Trend Tracker 2", projectDescription:"Although the previous TrendTracker is efficient enough for a couple thousand hashtags, it slows down as the size of the vector increases. This project uses an efficient two-vector-based data structure to speed up the base TrendTracker class. This faster class contains the same methods but using the help of the additional S integer vector, the running times are decreased. The S integer vector keeps track of the indices of the top trends and by populating the trend tracker in increasing order, a binary search can be performed to fetch a specific string in logarithmic time. Tweeted and Popularity can now be performed in O(log(n)); while top_three_trends is now a constant time function. Running it against 1.5 million hashtags, the program still has speedy execution times.", projectImages:["trendtracker2.png"]},

    {projectSection:"Algorithms & Data Structures",projectName: "Auto Completer", projectDescription:"The autocompleter project simulates that of a smartphoneâ€™s autocompleter feature. Given a substring, it provides the top three completions with the most frequency. This class uses an AVL binary search tree to provide speedy results. The search tree rebalances itself to insert in logarithmic time. Insertion works by firstly recursively inserting the new node; after that, the tree is rebalanced by performing the necessary rotations to keep the AVL rule always applicable (height difference between a right and left subtree cannot exceed one node).", projectImages:["autocompleter.png"]},
